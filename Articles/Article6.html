                <p>VATICAN- Vatican priests have uncovered the origins of the first baptism, taking place in ancient Rome sometime in the early 1st Century. Cardinal Angelo Scola explains, "apparently a group of passersby stumbled upon a self proclaimed holy man dubbed John the Baptist attempting to drown an infant. When he was questioned by the group, a visibly surprised John explained, 'Oh you thought... psh no! I would never! I can totally see how this looks, but there is a perfectly reasonable explanation for all this.' then a 5-15 second pause (Historians dispute over the exact time, explained Scola) ensued. John then continued 'This is to make the baby holy?' To which the crowd felt relieved because drowing infants is just something you didn't want to see back in that time" explained Scola. When asked how the crowd reacted to John's explanation, Scola states, "One of the members of the group asked John if they should all dunk there baby's in water, to which John replied 'Drown all your babies! You people make me sick!... oh wait right the holy thing... ya sure, go nuts.'"    </p>
