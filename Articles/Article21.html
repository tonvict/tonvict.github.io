            <h1>Man With Key Fetish Takes Advantage of Drunk Friends</h1>

                <p> A group of friends held an intervention for Carl, a local man who always demands his friends hand over their keys when they get overly intoxicated. "It's just hard to be around someone like that. Everytime we all hang out and get drunk, he doesn't even drink with us and then just asks us for our car keys... it's really sick." said one member of the intervention. "I just can't trust him enough to get drunk around him anymore. It's like he knows that's when our inhibitions are low and he can get to what he really wants... our car keys."
                    <br>
                    <br> Another member of the group described a harrowing time in which he passed out and awoke to Carl with his hands in his pocket trying to get his car keys. He explained “No one wants to wake up to that, especially not from your friend, someone you trust.”

                    <br>
                    <br> When asked to explain his actions, Carl couldn’t help but break down, stating “ I know I have a problem, and I need help, but I just love the feeling of your car keys in my hands.”
