                <ol>
                    <li> The Angel And Devil suggesting what you should do when in a moral quandry, he can see all of yours but not his own.</li>
                    <li> A little gnome that likes to steal little kids eyelashes; at first he thought it was super creepy, but over time has come to appreciate all that the gnome is doing for society.</li>
                   <li> An Armadillo named San Juan that spits fire, but not in an urban way. In a spooky way. </li>
                    <li> Jesus Christ but only when his eyes are closed.</li>
                    <li> Bruce Willis's ghost, which is especially scary because Bruce Willis isn't even dead yet.</li>
