                <p>SEATTLE- The Framm family could only look on in silent horror as the Jury read the verdict. After a five month-long trial in which the golden retriever, Buddy (formerly Old Blue), pled “not guilty” against charges of rape and murder of his 12 year-old teammate Joshua Framm. The jury was finally ready to read the verdict.
                    <br>
                    <br> Joshua had been a basketball player at a local elementary school where Buddy, his dog, had inexplicably been allowed to join the team. What many saw as a publicity stunt had actually resulted in the a complete shift in team dynamic. With Buddy leading the charge, the team managed to make it all the way to the championship game. It was at this time where Buddy’s aggressive nature became apparent to the public eye. Buddy took out the star player of the rival team with a lunging head butt, injuring him for the rest of his young career. Many fans cheered on his reckless behavior, labelling his physical play as "aggressive" or "competetive" as long as it lead to more wins for the franchise. 
                    <br>
                    <br> Former teammates had also complained of Buddy’s toxic locker room behavior. One anonymous player stated “He would come into the practice late and bark incessantly at us, nobody on the team  could understand barking, but we just assumed he was trying to tell us that he was tired of carrying the team and that we would be nothing without him”
                    <br>
                    <br> Multiple dentists and police forensic officials confirmed that the teeth marks found on Josh's neck and legs matched Buddy's perfectly. Also, the irritation found on the victim was equivalent to irritation caused by a tiny red dog penis. However, after much deliberation the Jury concluded that nowhere in the states law book does it say that a dog can't rape and murder. It appears that Air Bud, will fly freely once again.
