                <p>New Mexico - Five different teenagers were left embarrassed when they entered Rio Rancho High School, all wielding the same semi-automatic rifle. The teens were obviously frustrated, one saying "It was just so annoying, a lot of the other kids just made fun of us, saying stuff like like 'did you all plan this last night at your slumber party?' and 'I didn't know it was quintuplets day.'" <br>
                    <br> Mrs. Huckabee, a History teacher, voiced her sympathy for the students stating “Those poor kids… No one deserves to be made fun of, I had hoped that Rio Rancho would be a safe place for students emotional well being because it’s definitely not for students physical well being. As a teacher you expect kids to bring military-grade weapons to school but bullying is something that we cannot tolerate as a facility.”
