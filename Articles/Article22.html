                MEXICO- It was supposed to be a spring break that they would always remember, but it turned into a vacation they wish they could forget. On one of their bi-monthly Cabo trips, University of Alabama’s chapter of Pi Kappa Epsilon faced the untimely death of one of their members.
                <br>
                <br>
                Alex “A-Dog” Ramirez drowned while snorkeling in the Pacific Ocean. While there seems to be no foul play, witnesses explained to authorities that they heard his fellow fraternity members start chanting, “Chug! Chug! Chug!” at which point Mr. Ramirez reportedly dunked himself and his snorkel into the ocean and ballooned to 5 times his original size. Other witnesses report that that when Mr. Ramirez heard the “chug” chant, it was “like a sleeper cell operative getting activated by a code word.”
                <br>
                <br> Authorities confirmed “Mr. Ramirez drowned in an attempt to chug down the entire Pacific Ocean.”
                <br>
                <br> Alex will be remembered by his fellow fraternity members, until they graduate and never talk about him again.
