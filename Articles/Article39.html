                LOS ANGELES- In a an exciting turn of events, Netflix has announced that it will be expanding the on-screen universe of Black Mirror, with a new show starring a fan-favorite character from the past! Who is the star? Who else but the pig loving president from the very first episode! In the new series, we follow Michael Callow, who is blackmailed into having sex with a new animal every week.
                <br>
                <br> Rory Kinnear, who plays Michael in the show, conveyed a sense of gratitude to fans of the show, stating “If fans hadn’t pushed for more animal fucking, we wouldn’t have been able to make the show.” Rory’s stunt double Krevin Falmore was equally delighted, saying, “I can’t believe people keep paying me for this!”
