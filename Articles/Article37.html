                <p>A visibly annoyed Kurt Tillerson couldn’t help but mutter angrily to himself after discovering a rainbow forming outside his kitchen window. Kurt explained to reporters that he doesn’t mind that God is a homosexual, he just “wishes that he didn’t have to rub it in everyone's face all the time.”
                    <br><br> Local meteorologist James Mandelbaum explained to Tillerson that the rainbow was not an attempt for God to flaunt his homosexuality but rather a natural phenomenon that shows pride in something that was often seen as a negative quality in the past.
