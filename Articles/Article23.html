                    ILLINOIS- GOP candidate and Holocaust denier Arthur Jones and has been living under the impression that the six million plus Jews who were killed during 1939 to 1945 are living in a farm together upstate.
                    <br>
                    <br> When reporters asked Jones’ parents how he may have come about having such a skewed perspective, they explained “we just didn’t have the heart to tell Felix the dark truth about World War Two, we feel like he’d be much happier thinking that millions of Jews who were killed are living with their parents in Albany, NY”
