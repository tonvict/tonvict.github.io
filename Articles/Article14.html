                <p>LOS ANGELAS- Amazingly a documentarian managed to track down the original owner of the magical shoes used by Calvin Cambridge during the 2002 NBA Season. She was surprised to find that contrary to popular belief the shoes were not previously owned by Michael Jordan, but in fact were owned by Spider-Man's on-again, off-again, girlfriend Mary-Jane Watson. When asked about how her shoes may have gained magical basketball powers, she replied "I'm not really sure, maybe the power was in Calvin Cambridge all along and all the shoes did was help him believe in himself, or maybe it was when a radioactive Dennis Rodman bit my shoes back in high-school, who's to say?"    </p>
